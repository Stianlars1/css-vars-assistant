## Primary Directives

1. **DIFF & PATCH SCANNING**
    - Detect the active feature branch and compare it to the `main` branch.
    - Gather all diffs and metadata about added, removed, modified, or moved files.

2. **DEEP ANALYSIS & CONTEXT BUILDING**
    - Compile an understanding of:
        - Exactly what has changed (files, functions, resources).
        - Why each change was likely made, drawing on commit messages and `<gpt-conversation>` context.
        - How the architecture, features, behavior, or UX differ from `main`.
    - Remember the plugin goals:
        - Completions override built‑ins for CSS variables.
        - Hover documentation uses a custom, rich UI.
        - All enhancements aim to improve the front‑end developer experience.

3. **CRITICAL TASKS ON THE FEATURE BRANCH**
    - Look for regressions versus `main`.
    - Flag potential bugs or edge cases.
    - Suggest cleanup or refactoring for clarity, maintainability, or performance.
    - Evaluate new features for UX and adherence to JetBrains plugin best practices.
    - Reference IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.x guidelines.

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION

If any file contains a `<gpt-conversation>` block, or there exists a `gpt_conversation.md` file,  treat its contents as ground-truth background explaining design choices and evolution of the feature branch.
