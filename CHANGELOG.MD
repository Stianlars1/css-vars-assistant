# CSS Variables Assistant **(--)** Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and semantic-versioning.

---

## [1.4.1] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë06‚Äë05
### Improved
* Completion suggestions load faster with a project-level cache of variable names.
  The cache is cleared whenever the index is rebuilt.

---

## [1.4.0] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë06‚Äë02
### Changed
* **New defaults:** indexing scope now defaults to **GLOBAL** and **maxImportDepth** is **20** (was 10).
* Legacy settings are clamped to the new 1‚Äì20 range on load.
* Settings dialog pre‚Äëselects **Global scope** on first run.

### Fixed
* LESS/SCSS alias chains ending in arithmetic expressions now resolve to their literal values (e.g. `--less-variable-spacing--md ‚Üí 24px` not `--less-variable-spacing--md ‚Üí @less-variable-spacing-md`).
* Minor NPEs in completion popup when evaluating invalid pre‚Äëprocessor refs.

### Migration notes
Existing users keep their previous scope; switch manually via **Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí CSS Variables Assistant** or hit **Reset to Defaults** to adopt the new behaviour.

## [1.3.1] ‚Äì 2025-05-28
### Added
* **Enhanced Debug CSS Import Resolution** action ‚Äì comprehensive import chain analysis with tree visualization, variable counting, and detailed resolution paths.
* **Dedicated completion cache** (`CssVarCompletionCache`) ‚Äì separate caching system for LESS/SCSS variable resolution with improved performance.
* **Index rebuilder utility** (`CssVariableIndexRebuilder`) ‚Äì centralized index management for better code organization.
* **Dynamic completion popup width** ‚Äì automatically adjusts popup width based on longest variable name for better readability.
* **Enhanced progress reporting** ‚Äì detailed progress indicators for re-indexing operations with step-by-step feedback.

### Changed
* **Code architecture improvements** ‚Äì extracted cache and index management into dedicated utility classes for better maintainability.
* **Re-index process enhancement** ‚Äì more detailed progress reporting with visual feedback and error handling.
* **Import resolution debugging** ‚Äì comprehensive analysis shows full import trees, variable counts, and resolution failures.

### Fixed
* **Cache management** ‚Äì resolved issues with stale cache entries affecting completion accuracy.
* **Index rebuilding reliability** ‚Äì improved error handling and progress tracking during index operations.
* **Threading improvements** ‚Äì better handling of background tasks and cancellation scenarios.
* **Memory optimization** ‚Äì more efficient cache management reducing memory footprint.

---

## [1.3.0] ‚Äì 2025-05-27
### Added
* **Dynamic pre-processor resolution** ‚Äì fully resolves chained `@/ $/ --` references across LESS, SCSS, SASS & CSS, even inside imported packages.
* **Import-cache** ‚Äì remembers every file reached through `@import`, giving instant look-ups after the first index pass.
* **üîÑ Re-index Now** button ‚Äì available in **Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí CSS Variables Assistant**. Rebuilds the index without "Invalidate Caches / Restart".
* **Debug CSS Import Resolution** context-menu action ‚Äì prints the exact chain of resolved `@import`s for the selected file.
* **IDE progress integration** ‚Äì all long-running tasks are cancellable (Progress Manager).

### Changed
* **New default maxImportDepth** ‚á¢ `10` (was `3`).  
  Still user-configurable.
* **Icons** ‚Äì always use the plugin shield for variables originating from the assistant, regardless of scope.
* **Scope utilities** ‚Äì `ScopeUtil.effectiveCssIndexingScope()` and `currentPreprocessorScope()` consolidated; always compute a fresh scope for resolution paths.

### Fixed
* **Project + Imports scope** now resolves real values (e.g. `--theme-primary ‚Üí #1a73e8`) instead of showing the intermediate `@lessVar`.
* Missing completions when switching from *Project Only* to *Project + Imports* without restarting.
* Race condition that occasionally produced `ProcessCanceledException` in large projects.
* Import-depth recursion guard respected across mixed preprocessor stacks.
* Global scope no longer double-indexes the same node_modules files.

---

## [1.2.0] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë05‚Äë22
### Added
* **Advanced** `@import` resolution: intelligent resolution of `@import` statements across `CSS`, `SCSS`, `SASS`, and `LESS` files.
* **Smart** node_modules handling: properly resolves scoped packages like @company/package/path.
* **Configurable** indexing scope: choose between `project‚Äëonly`, `project + imports`, or `full global` indexing via Settings.
* **Import depth control:** configurable **maximum depth** for `@import` chains to **prevent** infinite recursion.
* **Enhanced settings panel:** fine‚Äëtune plugin behavior with expanded configuration options under `Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí CSS Variables Assistant`.

### Improved
* **Multi‚Äëextension support:** automatically tries `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less` extensions when resolving imports without explicit extensions.
* **Relative path resolution:** better handling of `./` and `../` import paths with proper extension priority based on importing file type.
* **Performance optimizations:** smarter file filtering and caching for **faster completion** suggestions in large projects.
* __Error handling:__ improved stability when processing malformed import statements or missing files.

### Fixed
* Import resolution now correctly distinguishes between relative paths and node_modules packages.
* Deprecated API usage replaced with modern IntelliJ Platform APIs.
* Better handling of circular import dependencies with visited file tracking.
* Improved compatibility with latest WebStorm/IntelliJ versions.

## [1.1.0] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë05‚Äë19
### Added
- **Alias resolution:** `--alias: var(--real);` now resolves to the literal value in completion & docs.
- **Duplicate squashing:** identical `(context,value)` pairs collapse into one row.
- **Smart sorting in docs:** order is Default / Light ‚Üí Dark ‚Üí `max‚Äëwidth` (desktop‚Äëfirst, large ‚Üí small) ‚Üí `min‚Äëwidth` (mobile‚Äëfirst, small ‚Üí large) ‚Üí other media queries.
- **Light counts as primary:** `prefers-color-scheme: light` is treated the same as `default`.
- **Stricter index filter:** template/text files are ignored.

### Changed
- Completion ‚Äútype text‚Äù mirrors the new smart order.
- Documentation shows context values instead of ‚Äú(+N)‚Äù when context display is enabled.
- `DoubleColorIcon` now appears even when light/dark values alias to colours.

### Fixed
- No more duplicate ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù rows for repeated declarations with the same value.
- Docs no longer show raw `var(--xyz)` when it can be resolved.
- Colour swatches & WebAIM links work for resolved aliases too.

## [1.0.2] ‚Äì 2025‚Äë05‚Äë19

### Added
- **Settings page:** Plugin is now user-configurable (toggle context-based variable values).
- **Smarter completions:**
  - Dual color swatch if a variable has both light and dark color values.
  - All original value syntaxes shown (e.g., `#fff`, `hsl(0 0% 100%)`, `rgb(‚Ä¶))`).
  - Context-aware completions: e.g. ‚Äúüåô‚Äù for dark mode, no overlays.
- **Color swatches:**
  - Now supports **shadcn/ui** color variables format, `--foreground: 0 0% 100%;`.
- **Robust comment parsing:** All major CSS comment styles now supported for variable docs (JSDoc, plain, single-line, multiline).
- **Context tracking:** Indexer now properly tracks context (media queries, dark/light, nested queries, etc).
- **Documentation enhancements:**
  - Multi-context variables shown as a table.
  - Color swatches always use original value syntax.
  - WebAIM contrast checker link for color variables.


### Changed
- **Consistent UI:**
  - No overlay/context icons on completion swatch‚Äîcontext info is right-aligned only.
  - Completions/docs now fully respect user settings.

### Fixed
- **Comment parsing bugs:** One-line, multi-line, and mixed-format doc-comments now always recognized.
